## Specification of requirements
### Identification of actors

- The mobile application (front-office side) can be used by: all users
voters) with an account in the system to benefit from the various functions

- Subscribe to one or more elections.
- Vote for a candidate in an election.
- Receive notifications (results available).
- See the start and end dates of each election.


## Functionality Expected back office functionality

PHP and MySQL during this project.


### MySQL

cation (Android, iOS, Javascript, Node.js, Java, Unity, PHP, C ++ ...). It proposes to host
in real-time databases, content, social authentication (Google, Face-
book, Twitter and Github), and notifications, or services, such as
real-time communication server. In our project, it will be used for notifications.

### OkHttp

synchronous on Android.

#### Volley 
is a more or less official bookstore because it is developed by Google, they
talk about it on the Android site, but it comes in the form of an external library. It is-
it is not integrated directly into the SDK, there is a guide on the SDK
install it you have to go to download the sources, create a JAR yourself, so a file library.
